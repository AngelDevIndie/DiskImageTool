# DiskImageTool
View and manipulate floppy disk images

This is a personal project of mine.  I decided to make the source code available in case anyone finds it useful, but at no time should it be considered production quality.

What does DiskImageTool do?

1. It allows you to view and perform simple repairs on IBM PC formatted floppy disk images
2. You can easily copy files out of the images by dragging and dropping
3. Easily edit a modified boot sector OEM ID using a built in database of suggestions.
4. Remove Created and Last Accessed date and time stamps from one or more directory entries.

Suggestions for new features are welcome.
